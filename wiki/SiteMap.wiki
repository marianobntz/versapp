#summary Sitemap handling of the application.

= Sitemap Handling =

The application defines a sitemap (by default located in _/sitemap.xml_), that includes all urls handled by the application.

== Request Handlers setup ==

Each new _route_ can define a *sitemap* attribute that defines if the handler URLs are included in the sitemap.
If the route defines a pattern instead of a simple path, the route has to define a _sitemap_args_ argument to define the list of arguments to use building URLs for the sitemap.

Sitemap args is a list used in [http://webapp-improved.appspot.com/guide/routing.html#guide-routing URI Routing].
{{{
models_args = []
for model in all_models:
	models_args.append(([], {'model_id': model.id}))

route = versapp.new_route(versapp.TemplateHandler, '/models/<model_id>', name='model', 
       template_file='html/model_.html', sitemap=True, sitemap_args=['model1', 'model2', 'model3', ])
}}}
