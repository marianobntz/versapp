#summary Sitemap handling of the application.

= Sitemap Handling =

The application defines a sitemap (by default located in _/sitemap.xml_), that includes all urls handled by the application.

= Request Handlers setup =

Each new _route_ can define a *sitemap* attribute that defines if the handler URLs are included in the sitemap.
If the route defines a pattern instead of a simple path, the route has to define a _sitemap_args_ argument to define the list of arguments to use building URLs for the sitemap.
